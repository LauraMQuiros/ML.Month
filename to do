- separate categorical from numerical
  - some categorical data can be made numerical (e.g. matchCapacity)
  - make categorical numerical using one-hot method
- remove unwanted variables 
  - URL, firstSeenAt, lastSeenAt are not useful
  - longitude and latitude can be removed since postal code already has the neighbourhood info
  - don't need both decriptions (only translated or original)
  - processing on description to only retrieve the key words (NLP thing)
- then somehow run some model - regression or something idk I didn't go to the NN lecture.
